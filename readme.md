# WeatherFlow Tempest UDP Relay

A fast and efficient UDP relay service designed to receive WeatherFlow Tempest locally broadcasted [UDP JSON data](https://weatherflow.github.io/SmartWeather/api/udp/v143/), optionally repackage it into the Ecowitt format, and then POST it to Hubitat for consumption.

## Features

- LAN communication only, no cloud/weather service needed.
- Entirely written in C++ with no dependencies, external libraries or additional packages to install.
- Small, fast, efficient and highly asynchronous with non-blocking I/O and multithreaded queue.
- Designed to leverage existing Hubitat driver infrastructure by emulating WeatherFlow REST API or Ecowitt protocols.
- Support for multiple Tempest stations

## Installation Instructions

Login to your Linux host, either locally or via SSH.

### Firewall

For the relay to properly receive UDP data from the WeatherFlow Tempest station, incoming port UPD 50222 needs to be open. If the host running the relay has a firewall and, for example, you are using UFW, you can use the following command:

```text
  ~# sudo ufw allow 50222/udp
```

### Test the UDP Relay

Now that UDP port 50222 is open let's test the relay to make sure it's properly receiving UDP data from the weather station. Download the relay from github, make it executable and then start it in tracing mode:

```text
  ~# wget https://github.com/padus/tempest/raw/main/bin/linux_x86_64/tempest
  ~# chmod +x tempest
  ~# ./tempest --trace
```

If the relay starts displaying incoming UDP data, it means everything is working as expected. Hit \<CTRL>+\<C> to exit the relay and delete the executable:

```text
  ~# rm ./tempest
```

### Install the UDP Relay as a System Service

For the relay to automatically start every time the host boots up, it needs to be installed as a system service. Download the relay from github and make it executable:

```text
  ~# sudo wget -P /usr/local/bin https://github.com/padus/tempest/raw/main/bin/linux_x86_64/tempest
  ~# sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tempest
```

Using your favourite editor (nano in this example) create the file */etc/systemd/system/tempest.service* with the content below, making sure to update the URL with the correct Hubitat ip address or hostname:

```text
  ~# sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tempest.service

     [Unit]
     Description=WeatherFlow Tempest UDP Relay

     Wants=network.target
     After=syslog.target network-online.target

     [Service]
     Type=forking
     ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/tempest "--url=http://<hubitat ip>:39501" --daemon
     Restart=on-failure
     RestartSec=60
     KillMode=process

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now we just need to create and start the service:

```text
  ~# sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  ~# sudo systemctl enable tempest
  ~# sudo systemctl start tempest
```

If the relay service is running correctly, the next command should display a green "dot" and "active" status:

```text
  ~# sudo systemctl status tempest
```

### Update the UDP Relay

To check the current relay version:

```text
  ~# sudo tempest --version
```

To update the relay:

```text
  ~# sudo systemctl stop tempest
  ~# sudo rm /usr/local/bin/tempest
  ~# sudo wget -P /usr/local/bin https://github.com/padus/tempest/raw/main/bin/linux_x86_64/tempest
  ~# sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tempest
  ~# sudo systemctl start tempest
```

### Uninstall the UDP Relay

To completely stop and remove the relay from the host:

```text
  ~# sudo systemctl stop tempest
  ~# sudo systemctl disable tempest
  ~# sudo systemctl daemon-reload  
  ~# sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/tempest
  ~# sudo rm /usr/local/bin/tempest  
```

### UDP Relay Logs and Statistics

To access relay logs:

```text
  ~# sudo grep tempest /var/log/daemon.log | less
  (type q to exit)
```

To display relay statistics:

```text
  ~# sudo tempest --stats
```

## Relay Command Line Reference

  ```text
  Usage:        tempest [OPTIONS]

  Commands:

  Relay:        tempest --url=<url> [--interval=<min>] [--log=<lev>] [--daemon]
  Trace:        tempest --trace [--interval=<min>] [--log=<lev>]
  Stop:         tempest --stop
  Stats:        tempest --stats
  Version:      tempest --version
  Help:         tempest [--help]

  Options:

  -u | --url=<url>      full URL to relay data to
  -i | --interval=<min> interval in minutes at which data is relayed:
                        1 <= min <= 30 (default if omitted: 5)
  -l | --log=<lev>      1) only errors
                        2) errors and warnings
                        3) errors, warnings and info (default if omitted)
                        4) errors, warnings, info and debug (everything)
  -d | --daemon         run as a background daemon
  -t | --trace          relay data to the terminal standard output
                        (if --interval is omitted the source UDP JSON
                        will be traced instead)
  -s | --stop           stop relaying/tracing and exit gracefully
  -x | --stats          print relay statistics
  -v | --version        print version information
  -h | --help           print this help

  Examples:

  tempest --url=http://hubitat.local:39501 --interval=5 --daemon
  tempest -u=192.168.1.100:39500 -l=2 -d
  tempest --stop
  ```
